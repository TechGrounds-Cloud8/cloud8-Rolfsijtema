# [Sec-01 Network Detection]
Analyse your network using Nmap, and use Wireshark to find out what happends when you open your internetbrowser. 

## Key terminology
Nmap (Network Mapper)
Nmap is now one of the core tools used by network administrators to map their networks. The program can be used to find live hosts on a network, perform port scanning, ping sweeps, OS detection, and version detection.

Hackers / security:
Why do hackers use Nmap?
Nmap can be used by hackers to gain access to uncontrolled ports on a system. All a hacker would need to do to successfully get into a targeted system would be to run Nmap on that system, look for vulnerabilities, and figure out how to exploit them. Hackers aren't the only people who use the software platform, however

Wireshark:
Wireshark is a network protocol analyzer, or an application that captures packets from a network connection, such as from your computer to your home office or the internet. Packet is the name given to a discrete unit of data in a typical Ethernet network. Wireshark is the most often-used packet sniffer in the world.

## Exercise
Study
Scan the network of your Linux machine using nmap. What do you find?
Open Wireshark in Windows/MacOS Machine. Analyse what happens when you open an internet browser. (Tip: you will find that Zoom is constantly sending packets over the network. You can either turn off Zoom for a minute, or look for the packets sent by the browser between the packets sent by Zoom.)
