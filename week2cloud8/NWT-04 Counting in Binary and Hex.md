### Overcome challanges
Understanding the way of calculating the BASE2 or Base16, divide or multiply, after 0123456789 you get ABCDE

### Results
Counting in base 2 
Base 2 is called: Binary Numbers calculations are multiplied bij 2
You can only write a 0 or 1,  2 is no option! than you get 1-0  
1 means on and 0 means off
0 0 0 1   numerical value 20
0 0 1 0   numerical value 21
0 1 0 0   numerical value 22
1 0 0 0   numerical value 23
