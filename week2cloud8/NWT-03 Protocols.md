[Give a short summary of the subject matter.]

## Key terminology
A network protocol is a agreement, how things should be developed, if everyone build there things around these protocols it will usually work on the IT/www...
fire and forget: TCP handshake is more reliable protocol to send  data.  
UDP is much faster but less reliable. 
HTTPS  and SSH have there own portnumbers. 

## Exercise
Identify several other protocols and their associated OSI layer. Name at least one for each layer.
Figure out who determines what protocols we use and what is needed to introduce your own protocol.
Look into wireshark and install this program. Try and capture a bit of your own network data. Search for a protocol you know and try to understand how it functions.

### Overcome challanges
what is needed to make ur own protocol, difficult to find this answer. 

### Results
Installed Wireshark, and fixed the Chmod issiue by installen an update.

Who determines Internet Protocol?
The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) coordinates the DNS, IP addressing, and other internet protocol resources. All domain names and IP addresses are allocated from IANA. Founded in the early '70s and led by John Postel, one of the fathers of the DNS, today it operates as a subsidiary organization of ICANN.

What is the need of protocol?
Protocols are rules which are needed so that unanimity and quality of a product can be maintained. Answer: Protocols are the set of rules used by the networks to identify how data is represented and communicated. It also helps in securing the data and checking and correcting errors.
