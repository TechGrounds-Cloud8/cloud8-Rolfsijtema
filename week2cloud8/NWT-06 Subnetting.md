# [Subnetting]
When 2 or more divices are connected we call it a Local Area Network (LAN), every host(device) has its own adres in this range. A Subnet Mask helps to (prefix) all this adresses, how many "bits" of the networkadres are reserved for the host/devices. A subnet is a smaller network within a bigger network. the subnet has a larger prefix than the larger network it is connected to. Subnet logically isolates the devices/host. 

## Key terminology
CIDR notation: 
(Classless Inter-Domain Routing) is an alternate method of representing a subnet mask. It is simply a count of the number of network bits (bits that are set to 1) in the subnet mask. And make IPadressen available. 

Subnet and subnetmask:
SUbnetting makes it more efficient to route data
A subnet (short of subnetwork) describes the specific part of a network that shares the networkâ€™s IP address but has a unique subnet address. 
A subnet mask, however, differentiates between the portion of an IP address that refers to the subnet and the portion which refers to the host.

Prefix:
Prefix is a measurement to quantify large number. In networking, prefix is used to quantify large number of hosts/networks - 10.0.0.0/8 and 10.0.0.0/24 is a prefix. My definition of BGP Prefix is a large number of networks learned via BGP Routing Protocol.

Bits:
Image result for bits in networking
The terms bits and bytes in computer networking refer to standard units of digital data transmitted over network connections. There are 8 bits for every 1 byte.

## Exercise
Design a network with the following parts:

1 private subnet with atleast 15 hosts. Only accessable within the LAN.
1 private subnet with atleast 30 hosts (excluding NAT gateway). This network should have internet access.
1 public subnet with a internet gateway. This subnet needs to be able to place atleast 5 hosts (excluding the internet gateway)

### Overcome challanges
Making it clear for myself how the structure works from a cloud. Find the logics about calculating Subnet IP. Understand wich class and amount of Host. "+2" 

### Results
The amount of subnet IPrange depends on:
Being cost effective. 
Does the compant need to add more hosts because of growth
Are there temparerely more hosts needed. 
below you find the network results diagram.
