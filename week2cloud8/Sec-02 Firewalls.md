# [Firewalls]
Firewalls are ment to protect ur private network against threats from the public internet. 
A mechanism to filter out malicious traffic before it crosses the network perimeter. Firewalls are manditory!!!


## Key terminology
REHL : Red Hat Enterprise Linux
Everywhere enterprise IT is headed, Red Hat® Enterprise Linux® is there. From the public cloud to the edge, it evolves to bring flexibility and reliability to new frontiers. This is the stable foundation for untold innovation.

CentOS:
Community-driven free software effort focused around the goal of providing a rich base platform for open source communities to build upon. CentOS Linux is downstream of Red Hat Enterprise Linux—most often used for development and deployment—and doesn't have a contribution model. 

Ubuntu Firewall: UFW
The Uncomplicated Firewall (ufw) is a frontend for iptables and is particularly well-suited for host-based firewalls. ufw provides a framework for managing netfilter, as well as a command-line interface for manipulating the firewall.

Study diffirent types of Firewalls
Stateful firewalls are capable of monitoring and detecting states of all traffic on a network to track and defend based on traffic patterns and flows. 

Stateless firewalls, however, only focus on individual packets, using preset rules to filter traffic.

Hardware-based firewalls. A hardware-based firewall is an appliance that acts as a secure gateway between devices inside the network perimeter and those outside it. ...

Software-based firewalls. A software-based firewall, or host firewall, runs on a server or other device. ...
Cloud/hosted firewalls.


## Exercise
Installeer een webserver op je VM.
Apache2
Bekijk de standaardpagina die met de webserver geïnstalleerd is.
Stel de firewall zo in dat je webverkeer blokkeert, maar wel ssh-verkeer toelaat.
Controleer of de firewall zijn werk doet.
