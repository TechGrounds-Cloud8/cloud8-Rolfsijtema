# [Well Architected Framework]

The way you set up your IT or your application, the architecture, is a big part of how your application runs, how secure it is, and how much it costs.

WAF: Well Architected Framework helps to design ur IT enviroment. 

WAF consists of six pillars, all with their own key concepts, design principles, and best practices. 

You should be able to name these pillars, as well as understand what they mean. You should also be able to think about architectures in the context of the Well Architected Framework.

## Key terminology

The mnemonic device for the six pillars is CROPSS (the first letter of each pillar

AWS has them ordered as OSRPCS, but thatâ€™s a little harder to remember.

**Cost optimization**

- the ability to run systems to deliver business value at the lowest price point
Best practices:
- Implement Cloud financial Management
- Adopt a consumption model
- Measure overall efficiency 
- Stop spending money on undifferentiated heavy lifting (let AWS do this for you)
- Analize and attribute expenditure

**Reliability**

- Ensure a workload can perform its intended function correctly and consistently
- This includes the ability to operate and test the workload through its total lifecycle
Best practices Reliability:
- Automatically recover from faillure
- Test recovery procedures
- Scale horizontally to increase aggregate workload availability
- stop guessing capacity
- Manage change in automation

**Operational Excellence**

- Perform operations as Code
- Make frequent, small, reversable changes
- Refine operations procedures frequently
- Anticipate faillures
- Learn from operational faillures


**Performance efficiency**

Best practices: 
- Democratize advanced technology's
- Go global in minutes
- use serverless architectures
- experiment more often
- Consider mechanical sympathy 

**Security**

Protect data, systems, and assets to take advantage of cloud technology's to improve your Security

Best practices for Security:
- Implement a strong identity foundation
- Enable traceability
- Apply security at all layers
- Automate security best practices
- Protect date in transit and also at rest
- Keep people away from data
- Prepaire for security events 

**Sustainability**

sustainability transformation

Best practices: 
- Region selection
- User behavior patterns
- Software and architecture patterns
- Data patterns
- Hardware patterns
- Development and deployment process
