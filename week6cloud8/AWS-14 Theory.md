[Give a short summary of the subject matter.]

## Key terminology

**ECS**
Amazon Elastic Container Service:
Run highly secure, reliable, and scalable containers

-  Launch thousands of containers across the cloud using your preferred continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD) and automation tools.
- Optimize your time with AWS Fargate serverless compute for containers, which eliminates the need to configure and manage control plane, nodes, and instances.
- Save up to 50 percent on compute costs with autonomous provisioning, auto-scaling, and pay-as-you-go pricing.
- Integrate seamlessly with AWS management and governance solutions, standardized for
compliance with virtually every regulatory agency around the globe.

Deploy in a hybrid environment:
- Build container-based applications on-premises or in the cloud with Amazon ECS Anywhere and enjoy consistent tooling, management, workload scheduling, and monitoring across environments.

Support batch processing: 
- Plan, schedule, and execute batch computing workloads across the full range of AWS services, including Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2), Fargate, and Amazon EC2 Spot Instances.

Scale web applications:
- Automatically scale and run web applications in multiple Availability Zones with the performance, scale, reliability, and availability of AWS.

- Business support
We recommend AWS Business Support if you are running production workloads on AWS and want 24x7 access to technical support from engineers, access to Health API, and contextual architectural guidance for your use-cases.

- Enterprise On-Ramp**
We recommend Enterprise On-Ramp if you have production/business critical workloads in AWS and want 24x7 access to technical support from engineers, access to Health API, consultative architectural guidance, and a pool of Technical Account Managers (TAMs) to coordinate access to AWS subject matter experts.

- Enterprice
We recommend Enterprise Support for 24x7 technical support from high-quality engineers, tools and technology to automatically manage health of your environment, consultative architectural guidance, and a designated Technical Account Manager (TAM) to coordinate access to proactive / preventative programs and AWS subject matter experts.
