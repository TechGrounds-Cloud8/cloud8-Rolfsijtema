# [Symmetric encryption]

In this excercise we learn about:
A Encryption is an important tool for securing data. 
Many thing you do on the internet is encrypted. 
We speak about data at rest or Data in Motion.  
We learn about the Caesar cipher.
Data encryption is a way of translating data from plaintext (unencrypted) to ciphertext (encrypted). 

## Key terminology
cryptography: This is the study of secure communications techniques. 
Symmetric encryption: uses a single key to encrypt and decrypt. This is the simplest kind of encryption that involves only one secret key to cipher and decipher information.

Cyphers to encode:

Cyphers are algorithms that are used to encrypt data.

## Exercise
Find two more historic ciphers besides the Caesar cipher.

Enigma Machine 
DES Data Encryption Standard.
These are not in use anymore because they are already "broken" 

Find two digital ciphers that are being used today.

block ciphers, which encrypt block of data of fixed size, and. AES-128
stream ciphers, which encrypt continuous streams of data.

Send a symmetrically encrypted message to one of your peers via the public Slack channel.

They should be able to decrypt the message using a key you share with them. 

Try to think of a way to share this encryption key without revealing it to everyone.
You need to create a Asymmetrical encryption key.   instead of Symmetrical. 

You are not allowed to use any private messages or other communication channels besides Slack. 

Analyse the shortcomings of this method.
You can't share the message and the key tru the same channel without sharing it with others.  Unless you send a private message.

### Overcome challanges
find a way to share message and KEY in same public channel with with/to your PEER, this is not possible.
